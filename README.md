This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that leads to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug is in the for loop condition, which incorrectly includes the index equal to the array length, causing an attempt to access an element outside the bounds of the array.  The solution corrects the loop condition to iterate only up to, but not including, the array's length.
